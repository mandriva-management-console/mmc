    """
    Simulates a CoHQuery structure.
 
    Based on lists of all columns of msc tables, ORM-like object 
    is mapped on a simple instance containing all needed attributes.

    Lists of columns can be generated from this query :

    select COLUMN_NAME from information_schema.columns 
     where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'msc' 
       and TABLE_NAME = '<table_name>';

    Its output is simply pasted into the factory attribute :
    <table_name>_cols

    ORM class to map must be named like :
    <table_name>_class

    This factory must be declared as __metaclass__.
